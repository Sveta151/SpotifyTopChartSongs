This project is made for analysation of the popular songs from different decades. Aim of this project is to find any correlations and get insights.


Music accompanies us everywhere. We can hear it anywhere – at home, in shops, on the way to work, on the car radio, or at concerts. Music can raise someone’s mood, get them excited, or make them calm and relaxed. Music also allows us to feel nearly or possibly all emotions that we experience in our lives. The possibilities are endless.
Music is seasonal. During the spring we prefer to listen to more lively songs, while every Christmas we turn on our favorite holiday’s tunes. Every year there are new songs that become popular and play in our heads all day long. Some of them stay in our playlists for a longer time than others.
For this project I decided to analyze the popular songs from different decades.Aim of this project is to find any correlations in this data and get insights. 
The target audience is anyone who is interested in music and wants to know more about trends, how the world situation affects worldwide music trends and other interesting correlations.

For dataset have been used all-time top 2000s Spotify data set consisting of famous songs from the 50s to present. This allows us to look at the musci taste trends over the decades. Also for more detailed information have been used top charts in Spotify songs fro years 2019, 2020 and 2021. Comparing these datasets with data of Covid cases allows us to analyze how world situation with covid can influence trends in music.
